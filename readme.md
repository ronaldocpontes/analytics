### Python General

* [High performance collections](http://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html)
  This module implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Python’s general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple

* [Python efficient itertools](http://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html)
  The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an “iterator algebra” making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.
